## My Story  

I was born and grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, and lived for a few years in India when I was younger. My undergraduate 
education was at UC Berkeley, where I studied chemical engineering and materials science, and worked in Professor Nitash 
Balsara's research group on polymer electrolytes for lithium batteries. After graduating, I moved a few miles down the coast 
to UC Santa Barbara, where I recently completed my PhD in materials science. My graduate research, in Professor Michael Chabinyc's 
group, was focused on structural and electronic characterization of layered hybrid halide perovskites (more info can be found on the 
[research](/research/) and [publications](/publications/) pages).  

Outside of research and work, I have a variety of hobbies. I have always really enjoyed playing music -- I learned to play the piano 
when I was younger and played alto saxophone in my middle school and high school concert and jazz bands. I am also a self-taught 
guitarist, and somewhat of a "professional car karaoke singer". In addition to music, I am an avid amateur photographer who loves 
traveling -- you can see some of my work on the [photos](/photos/) page. I am the proud owner of a 3D printer (Creality Ender 3), 
and have really embraced the maker culture. Some of my designs can be found at my [Thingiverse profile](https://www.thingiverse.com/naveenv92/about). Finally, I enjoy cooking (especially the science aspect of cooking -- shoutout to [The Food Lab](https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab)) and also playing golf (in addition to a variety of other sports).
