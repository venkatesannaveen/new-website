<p>I was born and grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, and lived for a few years in India when I was younger. My undergraduate
education was at UC Berkeley, where I studied chemical engineering and materials science, and worked in Professor Nitash
Balsara&rsquo;s research group on polymer electrolytes for lithium batteries. After graduating, I moved a few miles down the coast
to UC Santa Barbara, where I recently completed my PhD in materials science. My graduate research, in Professor Michael Chabinyc&rsquo;s
group, was focused on structural and electronic characterization of layered hybrid halide perovskites (more info can be found on the
<a href="/research/">research</a> and <a href="/publications/">publications</a> pages).</p>
<p>Outside of research and work, I have a variety of hobbies. I have always really enjoyed playing music &ndash; I learned to play the piano
when I was younger and played alto saxophone in my middle school and high school concert and jazz bands. I am also a self-taught
guitarist, and somewhat of a &ldquo;professional car karaoke singer&rdquo;. In addition to music, I am an avid amateur photographer who loves
traveling &ndash; you can see some of my work on the <a href="/photos/">photos</a> page. I am the proud owner of a 3D printer (Creality Ender 3),
and have really embraced the maker culture. Some of my designs can be found at my <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/naveenv92/about">Thingiverse profile</a>. Finally, I enjoy cooking (especially the science aspect of cooking &ndash; shoutout to <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/the-food-lab">The Food Lab</a>) and also playing golf (in addition to a variety of other sports).</p>
